## About the Beta test

Welcome to the Beta test of this Haskell course! The course material
is finished, but we'd like your feedback on how we can make everything
better for the real launch of the course. Please give feedback via

- The course [channel on Telegram](https://t.me/haskell_mooc_fi)
- The feedback forms at the end of each lecture
- You can also email <joel.kaasinen+mooc-feedback@gmail.com>

We'd like to hear how you find the course, and especially if you find
problems with the exercises or omissions in the material. However all
sorts of feedback is welcome. If you're unsure about something, ask!

## Material

The material is available as [part1.html](part1.html) in this repository.

## Exercises

Exercises can be found under `exercises/`. Exercises are Haskell
source code files named `Set1.hs`, `Set2.hs` and so on. You complete
the exercises by editing the file according to the instructions in the
file. You can check your answers by running

```
stack runhaskell SetXTest.hs
```

in the `exercises/` directory. Remember to replace `X` with the number
of the set you are working on.


See [the material](part1.html#working-on-the-exercises) for more info.
